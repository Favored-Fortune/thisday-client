## User stories and strech goals:

As a user, I want the option of an overvirew as well as more detail of the news on that day.
As a developer, I want to use web APIs to get the data for the day in question and format it to display for the user.
As a developer, I want to store the user information such as user name, password, and favorite date searched in a database so when the user returns I will be able to properly log them in and provide their favorite date already entered in the date form. 
As a developer, I want to save any API keys in such a way as it cannot be accessed by the view.
As a developer, I want to have a strech goal of offering the user a star chart for the location and date they enter.
